# Blackjack CardCounter

My own implementation of a Blackjack game. Has all basic player options (Hit, Stay, Double Down) except Split currently. Simple Player makes all decisions according to traditional thought based on minimum bet. KO Counter keeps running count of seen cards and shifts bet based on strength of table.
